# Assets for README

## Web App Screenshots

Please add the following screenshots from https://base-lint.netlify.app/ to this folder:

1. **terminal-home.png** - The main terminal interface (home page)
2. **code-examples.png** - The code examples page showing React/Vue/Lodash examples
3. **repo-scanner.png** - The GitHub repository analysis interface

### How to Upload to GitHub

Once you have the screenshots:

1. Upload them to this `assets/` folder
2. Update the README.md image links:

Replace:
```markdown
![Baseline Lint Terminal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/your-terminal-screenshot-1.png)
```

With:
```markdown
![Baseline Lint Terminal](./assets/terminal-home.png)
```

Or upload to GitHub Issues to get permanent URLs:
1. Go to any GitHub issue
2. Drag and drop the images
3. Copy the generated URLs
4. Update the README with those URLs

### Current Screenshots in Root

The root folder already has some screenshots:
- Screenshot from 2025-10-05 07-48-50.png
- Screenshot from 2025-10-05 07-49-10.png
- Screenshot from 2025-10-05 07-49-22.png

These can be moved here or new ones can be added for the web app.
