## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-01

### 🎯 Enhanced Baseline Compatibility Detection

#### Fixed
- ✅ **Resolved Unknown Status Warnings** - Fixed "Unknown Baseline status" warnings for widely supported CSS properties and JavaScript APIs
- ✅ **Improved BCD Integration** - Enhanced Browser Compatibility Data integration with intelligent fallback strategies
- ✅ **Better Accuracy** - Added comprehensive fallback mappings for common features like `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `background-color`, `console`, `Promise`, `Symbol`, etc.
- ✅ **Reduced False Warnings** - Significantly reduced false "Unknown Baseline status" warnings while maintaining accuracy
- ✅ **CLI Hang / Workflow Exit** - Added graceful shutdown: implemented `PerformanceMonitor.stop()`, switched to `program.parseAsync()`, ensured timers (memory + logger flush) are cleared so CI workflows proceed to next phase without hanging

#### Added
- ✅ **CSS Fallback Mappings** - Added fallback data for 15+ common CSS properties
- ✅ **JavaScript Fallback Mappings** - Added fallback data for 20+ common JavaScript APIs
- ✅ **Enhanced CSS Parser** - Improved CSS keyword detection and filtering
- ✅ **Extended JavaScript Coverage** - Added more modern ES features to API detection
